Battery chargers not intended for normal household use, but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as battery chargers intended for use in garages, shops, light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction; children playing with the appliance. This standard does not apply to built-in:<br />\\n- battery chargers, except those for installing in caravans and similar vehicles;<br />\\n- battery chargers that are part of an appliance, the battery of which is not accessible to the user;<br />\\n- battery chargers intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\\n- battery chargers intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\\n- battery chargers for emergency lighting or supply units for electronic equipment. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2002 including its Amendment 1 (2004) and its Amendment 2 (2009). It constitutes a technical revision. The principal changes in this edition as compared with the fourth edition of IEC 60335-2-29 are as follows (minor changes are not listed):<br />\\n- Revised the drop test to refer to IEC 60068-2-31 (21.101);<br />\\n- Requirements for supply cords on battery chargers used at low temperatures (25.7);<br />\\n- Requirements for battery chargers having an output voltage exceeding SELV have been added (1, 3.2.2, 3.4.3, 10.101, 24.4, 25.5, 25.7, 25.8, 25.15. 26.5);<br />\\n- A classification for battery chargers used outdoors has been added (6.2, 29.2) and some notes in Clause 1, Subclauses 7.1 and 22.102, Figure 101 and Annex AA 11.8 have been converted to normative text.

The principal changes in this edition as compared with the second edition of IEC 60335-2-75 are as follows: some notes have been deleted or converted to normative text (5.2, 5.6, 5.104, 7.12.1, 7.12.101.1, 11.2, 11.8, 15.2.103, 15.2.104, 15.2.106, 15.2.109, 15.2.111, 19.102, 19.6, 19.13, 19.101, 22.6, 22.7, 22.112, 22.113, 22.114, 24.102, 27.2), added requirements for espresso coffee makers in 3.115, 22.114 and throughout standard, modified 11.4 to address heating appliances with electronic process controls and 11.6 to address combined appliances without electronic process controls, modified Clause 22 to indicate that pressure regulating devices are to be rendered inoperable and deleted ISO 13732-1 from Bibliography. The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.

Appliances covered by the scope of this standard include but are not limited to:<br />\\n- appliances for control of hair growth and<br />\\n- appliances for skin and beauty care incorporating lasers or intense light sources (ILS). Appliances incorporating lasers or intense light sources (ILS) either heat up hair follicles or skin tissue to produce thermal effects or to produce photo-biological effects from specific wavelengths. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction or<br />\\n- children playing with the appliance. The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this standard be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.

This part of IEC 62552 also defines the determination of volume.<br />\\n- All parts of the standard have been largely rewritten and updated to cope with new testing requirements, new product configurations, the advent of electronic product controls and computer based test-room data collection and processing equipment.<br />\\n- For more efficient analysis and to better characterise the key product characteristics under different operating conditions, the test data from many of the energy tests in Part 3 (this part) is now split into components (such as steady state operation and defrost and recovery). The approach to determination of energy consumption has been completely revised, with many internal checks now included to ensure that data complying with the requirements of the standard is as accurate as possible and of high quality.<br />\\n- Part 3 (this part) now provides a method to quantify each of the relevant energy components and approaches on how these can be combined to estimate energy under different conditions on the expectation that different regions will select components and weightings that are most applicable when setting both their local performance and energy efficiency criteria while using a single set of global test measurements.<br />\\n- For energy consumption measurements in Part 3 (this part), no thermal mass (test packages) is included in any compartment and compartment temperatures are based on the average of air temperature sensors (compared to the temperature in the warmest test package). There are also significant differences in the position of temperature sensors in unfrozen compartments.<br />\\n- The energy consumption test in Part 3 (this part) now has two specified ambient temperatures (16°C and 32°C).<br />\\n- A load processing energy efficiency test has been added in Part 3 (this part).<br />\\n- Tests (both performance (Part 2) and energy (Part 3 (this part)) have been added for wine storage appliances.', metadata={'source': (None,), 'seq_num': 363, 'domain': (None,), 'id': ('IEC 62552-3:2015',), 'branch': ('IEC -> SC_59M',), 'year_public': (1423810800000,), 'status': ('Còn hiệu lực',), 'name_en': ('Household refrigerating appliances - Characteristics and test methods - Part 3: Energy consumption and volume',), 'name_vn': None}),\n",

The objective is to enable operational run-time data exchange among these IEDs / subsystems, and to automate the configuration of a gateway as much as possible.<br />\\nPlease note that for the purposes of this document, \"Modbus\" is used to represent both serial Modbus (Modbus RTU) and IEC 61158-6 (Modbus TCP).<br />\\nWithin the capability of each protocol, some configuration attributes (IEC 61850-7-3:2010+AMD1:2020 attributes with functional constraint CF) are also mapped in addition to the operational real-time data.<br />\\nThe rules specified in this document are based on the published standards and do not make any proposed changes to IEC 61850 or 61158-6. This standard does not specify any rules for an IEC 61850 IED to directly communicate with a Modbus IED and vice versa, except through a gateway.<br />\\nThis document does not mandate which data items that a particular IED shall support, regardless of whether the implementation uses Modbus or IEC 61850. Instead this document provides rules specifying how a gateway maps any given data item from one protocol to the other, given that the data item is already available and is transmitted using one of the protocols.<br />\\nSimilarly, this document does not mandate which mapping rules a given gateway shall support. When this document is republished as a Technical Specification, conformance requirements will be identified.<br />\\nThis document recognizes that there will be situations in which a user will require that a gateway perform non-standard protocol mappings. Non-standard mappings are outside the scope of this document.<br />\\nThis document also recognizes that gateways typically manipulate the data passing through them in a variety of ways. Some of these functions include alarm trigger grouping, data suppression, interlocking and command blocking. Conformance to this document does not preclude a gateway from performing such functions, even though this document primarily specifies \"straight through\" mapping of Modbus data to IEC 61850-7-3:2010+AMD1:2020 data. Subclause 7.4 of this document describes how some of these functions may be specified to a gateway by a mapping tool using equation notation in XML. However, some of these functions may be too complex for a mapping tool to specify in an automated manner.<br />\\nThe mapping architecture for the exchange of the run-time information consists of four parts:<br />\\n1) Conceptual architecture of a gateway and associated use case<br />\\n2) Mapping of the information model (Assign semantic to the Modbus data)<br />\\n3) Mapping of the data (which is in fact part of the information model)<br />\\n4) Mapping of the services (out of scope for this document)', metadata={'source': (None,), 'seq_num': 616, 'domain': (None,), 'id': ('IEC TR 61850-80-5:2024',), 'branch': ('IEC -> TC_57',), 'year_public': (1707462000000,), 'status': ('Còn hiệu lực',), 'name_en': ('Communication networks and systems for power utility automation - Part 80-5: Guideline for mapping information between IEC 61850 and IEC 61158-15',), 'name_vn': None}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Energy management system application program interface (EMS-API) - Part 457: Dynamics profile\\n\\nIEC 61970-457:2024 specifies a standard interface for exchanging dynamic model information needed to support the analysis of the steady state stability (small-signal stability) and/or transient stability of a power system or parts of it. The schema(s) for expressing the dynamic model information are derived directly from the CIM, more specifically from IEC 61970-302.<br />\\nThe scope of this document includes only the dynamic model information that needs to be exchanged as part of a dynamic study, namely the type, description and parameters of each control equipment associated with a piece of power system equipment included in the steady state solution of a complete power system network model. Therefore, this profile is dependent upon other standard profiles for the equipment as specified in IEC 61970-452: CIM static transmission network model profiles, the topology, the steady state hypothesis and the steady state solution (as specified in IEC 61970-456: Solved power system state profiles) of the power system, which bounds the scope of the exchange. The profile information described by this document needs to be exchanged in conjunction with IEC 61970-452 and IEC 61970-456 profiles’ information to support the data requirements of transient analysis tools. IEC 61970-456 provides a detailed description of how different profile standards can be combined to form various types of power system network model exchanges.<br />\\nThis document supports the exchange of the following types of dynamic models:<br />\\n• standard models: a simplified approach to exchange, where models are contained in predefined libraries of classes interconnected in a standard manner that represent dynamic behaviour of elements of the power system. The exchange only indicates the name of the model along with the attributes needed to describe its behaviour.<br />\\n• proprietary user-defined models: an exchange that would provide users the ability to exchange the parameters of a model representing a vendor or user proprietary device where an explicit description of the model is not described in this document. The connections between the proprietary models and standard models are the same as described for the standard models exchange. Recipient of the data exchange will need to contact the sender for the behavioural details of the model.<br />\\nThis document builds on IEC 61970-302, CIM for dynamics which defines the descriptions of the standard dynamic models, their function block diagrams, and how they are interconnected and associated with the static network model. This type of model information is assumed to be pre-stored by all software applications hence it is not necessary to be exchanged in real-time or as part of a dynamics model exchange.<br />\\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\\na) The majority of issues detected in IEC 61970-302:2018 and fixed in IEC 61970-302:2022 led to update of this document;<br />\\nb) IEEE 421.5-2016 on Excitation systems is fully covered;<br />\\nc) IEEE turbine report from 2013 was considered and as a result a number of gas, steam and hydro turbines/governors are added;<br />\\nd) IEC 61400-27-1:2020 on wind turbines is fully incorporated;<br />\\ne) WECC Inverter-Based Resource (IBR) models, Hybrid STATCOM models and storage models are added;<br />\\nf) The user defined models approach was enhanced in IEC 61970-302:2022 adding a model which enables modelling of a detailed dynamic model. This results in the creation of two additional profiles in this document. These are the Detailed Model Configuration profile and Detailed Model Parameterisation profile;<br />\\ng) A model to enable exchange of simulation results was added in IEC 61970-302:2022. This results in the creation of two additional profiles in this document. These are the Simulation Settings profile and Simulation Results profile;<br />\\nh) The work on the HVDC models is not complete. The HVDC dynamics models are a complex domain in which there are no models that are approved or widely recognised on international level, i.e. there are only project-based models. At this stage IEC 61970-302:2022 only specifies some general classes. However, it is recognised that better coverage of HVDC will require a further edition of this document as well as next edition of IEC 61970-302;<br />\\ni) Models from IEEE 1547-2018 \"IEEE Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Distributed Energy Resources with Associated Electric Power Systems Interfaces\" are added.<br />\\nj) Statements have been added to certain figures, tables, schemas, and enumerations throughout the document that indicate that they are reproduced with the permission of the UCA International User Group (UCAIug).

RBAC assigns human users, automated systems, and software applications (collectively called \"subjects\" in this document) to specified \"roles\", and restricts their access to only those resources, which the security policies identify as necessary for their roles.<br />\\nAs electric power systems become more automated and cyber security concerns become more prominent, it is becoming increasingly critical to ensure that access to data (read, write, control, etc.) is restricted. As in many aspects of security, RBAC is not just a technology; it is a way of running a business. RBAC is not a new concept; in fact, it is used by many operating systems to control access to system resources. Specifically, RBAC provides an alternative to the all-or-nothing super-user model in which all subjects have access to all data, including control commands.<br />\\nRBAC is a primary method to meet the security principle of least privilege, which states that no subject should be authorized more permissions than necessary for performing that subject’s task. With RBAC, authorization is separated from authentication. RBAC enables an organization to subdivide super-user capabilities and package them into special user accounts termed roles for assignment to specific individuals according to their associated duties. This subdivision enables security policies to determine who or what systems are permitted access to which data in other systems. RBAC provides thus a means of reallocating system controls as defined by the organization policy. In particular, RBAC can protect sensitive system operations from inadvertent (or deliberate) actions by unauthorized users. Clearly RBAC is not confined to human users though; it applies equally well to automated systems and software applications, i.e., software parts operating independent of user interactions.<br />\\nThe following interactions are in scope:<br />\\n– local (direct wired) access to the object by a human user; by a local and automated computer agent, or built-in HMI or panel;<br />\\n– remote (via dial-up or wireless media) access to the object by a human user;<br />\\n– remote (via dial-up or wireless media) access to the object by a remote automated computer agent, e.g. another object at another substation, a distributed energy resource at an end-user’s facility, or a control centre application.<br />\\nWhile this document defines a set of mandatory roles to be supported, the exchange format for defined specific or custom roles is also in scope of this document.<br />\\nOut of scope for this document are all topics which are not directly related to the definition of roles and access tokens for local and remote access, especially administrative or organizational tasks.', metadata={'source': (None,), 'seq_num': 699, 'domain': (None,), 'id': ('IEC 62351-8:2020',), 'branch': ('IEC -> TC_57',), 'year_public': (1588057200000,), 'status': ('Còn hiệu lực',), 'name_en': ('Power systems management and associated information exchange - Data and communications security - Part 8: Role-based access control for power system management',), 'name_vn': None}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Power systems management and associated information exchange - Data and communications security - Part 9: Cyber security key management for power system equipment\\n\\nIEC 62351-9:2023 specifies cryptographic key management, primarily focused on the management of long-term keys, which are most often asymmetric key pairs, such as public-key certificates and corresponding private keys. As certificates build the base this document builds a foundation for many IEC 62351 services (see also Annex A). Symmetric key management is also considered but only with respect to session keys for group-based communication as applied in IEC 62351-6. The objective of this document is to define requirements and technologies to achieve interoperability of key management by specifying or limiting key management options to be used.<br />\\nThis document assumes that an organization (or group of organizations) has defined a security policy to select the type of keys and cryptographic algorithms that will be utilized, which may have to align with other standards or regulatory requirements. This document therefore specifies only the management techniques for these selected key and cryptography infrastructures. This document assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of cryptography and key management principles.<br />\\nThe requirements for the management of pairwise symmetric (session) keys in the context of communication protocols is specified in the parts of IEC 62351 utilizing or specifying pairwise communication such as:<br />\\n• IEC 62351-3 for TLS by profiling the TLS options<br />\\n• IEC 62351-4 for the application layer end-to-end security<br />\\n• IEC TS 62351-5 for the application layer security mechanism for IEC 60870-5-101/104 and IEEE 1815 (DNP3)<br />\\nThe requirements for the management of symmetric group keys in the context of power system communication protocols is specified in IEC 62351-6 for utilizing group security to protect GOOSE and SV communication. IEC 62351-9 utilizes GDOI as already IETF specified group-based key management protocol to manage the group security parameter and enhances this protocol to carry the security parameter for GOOSE, SV, and PTP.<br />\\nThis document also defines security events for specific conditions which could identify issues which might require error handling. However, the actions of the organisation in response to these error conditions are beyond the scope of this document and are expected to be defined by the organizations security policy.<br />\\nIn the future, as public-key cryptography becomes endangered by the evolution of quantum computers, this document will also consider post-quantum cryptography to a certain extent. Note that at this time being no specific measures are provided.<br />\\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2017.

The purpose of failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is to establish how items or processes might fail to perform their function so that any required treatments could be identified. An FMEA provides a systematic method for identifying modes of failure together with their effects on the item or process, both locally and globally. It may also include identifying the causes of failure modes. Failure modes can be prioritized to support decisions about treatment. Where the ranking of criticality involves at least the severity of consequences, and often other measures of importance, the analysis is known as failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA). This document is applicable to hardware, software, processes including human action, and their interfaces, in any combination.

This type of welding uses ultrasonic vibration to join materials together, creating a bond that is both strong and reliable. Ultrasonic welding has been identified as a process in ISO 4063-41 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).<br />\\nThe process of ultrasonic welding relies on high frequency ultrasound waves being used to create frictional heat at the connection point. High temperature is not required for this special method of welding, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to join two materials together.<br />\\nIt also requires fewer steps than traditional methods, meaning it can be completed quickly and with minimal resources.<br />\\nUltrasonic welding has been around for decades but only recently has become more widely utilized due to advances in technology and its availability at lower cost. It can be used on many different materials including plastics, rubbers, metals, textiles, and composites. Due to its precision and strong bonds it creates, it has become extremely popular in manufacturing processes such as automotive industry, electronics industry, furniture production and even medical device production.<br />\\nThis document covers ultrasonically welded connections made with stranded or flexible wires (class 2, 5 or 6 per IEC 60228) of copper or copper alloy, as well as of aluminium or aluminium alloy.
